 * <p>
 * Line (with slope) wavelet
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The wavelet Lifting Scheme "LineWavelet" wavelet approximates the data set
 * using a LineWavelet with with slope (in contrast to the HaarWavelet wavelet
 * where a LineWavelet has zero slope is used to approximate the data).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The predict stage of the LineWavelet wavelet "predicts" that an odd point
 * will lie midway between its two neighboring even points. That is, that the
 * odd point will lie on a LineWavelet between the two adjacent even points. The
 * difference between this "prediction" and the actual odd value replaces the
 * odd element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The update stage calculates the average of the odd and even element pairs,
 * although the method is indirect, since the predict phase has over written the
 * odd value.

     * calculated as the average of the even element and its associated odd
     * element (e.g., its odd neighbor before the split). This is not possible
     * in the LineWavelet wavelet since the odd element has been replaced by the

     * neighbors. As a result, the odd element cannot be recovered.
